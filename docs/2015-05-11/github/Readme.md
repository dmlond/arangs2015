Github
========

Github is a publicly accessible location to store git repositories. The
philosophy of Github is to promote OpenSource software distribution.
  * Any user can create a free account
  * Free accounts allow an unlimited number of public repositories,
    with an unlimited number of external collaborators
  * See [Github Pricing](https://github.com/pricing)
  * Users can pay to house private repositories with controlled access
Github also has support for Organizations, with similar pricing.

Github as Reproducible Science Hub
---------------------
Many scientists have experimented with the use of Github as a hub to promote
reproducible science computation:
  * Using Github as a place to store publicly accessible code repositories
    with documentation, and using the Github url as a reference in paper
    citations
  * Experimenting with ways to use 'Forks' as a proxy for code 'citation'
    counts
  * Experimenting with use of Github as a public data repository
  * E-Lab Notebooks
  * Some [initiatives](https://osf.io/) have even built web platform onto
    github to wrap and extend its features to create a workflow more appropriate for large, distributed research projects

Recently Github has begun directly promoting themself as a [platform for reproducible science](https://github.com/blog/1840-improving-github-for-science):
  * DOI identifiers to cite research computation code
  * Free/reduced price academic accounts
  * [Large File Storage](https://github.com/blog/1986-announcing-git-large-file-storage-lfs) to allow researchers to store larger data files within the github change management framework

Lesson Plan:
------------
    * Create a Free Github Account
    * Tour the github web interface as we learn about the class data and software
    * Fork our Repository
    * clone your forked repository using git
    * set up an ssh key with Github and your class machine
