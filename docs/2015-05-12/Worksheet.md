Launching a tiny Linux by hand on Virtualbox

- Download the [SliTaz](http://www.slitaz.org/en/get/) ISO and launch it as a LiveCD in VirtualBox (no virtual drive needed)
- In Virtualbox, look at the different ways to end the SliTaz process. What are the differences between "pause", "save state" and "power off"? In what state are you able to change the system settings of the VM?
- How much RAM is assigned by Virtualbox to the VM? By how much can you increase that "in the green"?
- How many processors are assigned? By how much can this be increased?
- In SliTaz, what package manager does this Linux distribution use?
- Would you be able to compile from source on this VM in its current state?
- What tools would you look for to check if you can compile from source?
- Is git installed?
